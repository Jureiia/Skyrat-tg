changes: 
  - bugfix: "Buckling yourself to and then unbuckling yourself from a stasis bed will no longer permanently halt the effects of any gravitum in your system."
  - bugfix: "Liverless creatures can no longer retain the effects of gravitum indefinitely, as it will now decay in their bodies (just as it does in the bodies of livered creatures)."
